# Bus-Route-Planner - مخطط مسار الحافلة

**Bus Route Planner** is a serverless React application designed to streamline student transportation management. It generates optimized bus routes, organizes station stops with precise timings, and manages subscriptions for students and their guardians. The app demonstrates the integration of scheduling algorithms with external JSON data storage to solve logistical challenges effectively.

---

## Context

This project was built upon a real request from a bus company owner (January 2023) who faced challenges in writing schedules and creating roadmaps for bus drivers due to complicated schedules from different students/schools. The app was developed as a practical solution to address these issues, saving time and reducing errors in manual scheduling. By automating the process, the app not only solved a logistical problem but also improved operational efficiency for the bus company.

To demonstrate its capabilities without exposing sensitive information, fake data has been generated for demo purposes.
